# savedelete-notes

This app allows users to create, save and delete multiple notes they make! 
Theres a space to enter a title for your notes and a space below to type out what you want your notes to be!
This was made using Javascript, and html. Dependencies that were utilized were Express, Path and UUID. Using UUID allowed me to give each saved note a unique id to be saved to and deleted with.
